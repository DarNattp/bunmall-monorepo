# Database Connection
# Used by all services. Note: When running in Docker, 'localhost' should be replaced by 'postgres' if using internal networking, but for local tools/migrations 'localhost' is correct.

# JWT Secret
# Used by auth-service for signing tokens.
JWT_SECRET="secret-key-for-dev"

# Service URLs

# Locally, they point to localhost ports.
